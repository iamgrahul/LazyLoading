You can search for thousands of celestial sights and be guided exactly where to see them in the sky above you. Just follow the arrow.\n\nVoyage to the past or future with cinematic time controls. Know where the Moon will be later in the evening so you can capture that perfect photo.

The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds!

You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights!

Storm Shield Weather Radio gives you storm-based alerts for tornado, hurricane, flood, thunderstorm, winter storms and other life-threatening weather events via voice and push notification.\n\nStorm-based or polygon alerts help reduce false alarms by alerting you to severe weather based on your exact location within a county. Many other products still use county-based alerts (meaning you'd get an alert even if your location in the county is not within the threatened area).\n\n\nWhat people are saying:\n• Storm Shield \"can keep you appraised of everything from severe thunderstorms to flash flooding... this kind of information can be a life-saver, as many of its loyal users have already attested.\" - Time.com\n\n• Storm Shield \"alerted our family of the Broken Arrow, OK tornado, faster than the TV and tornado sirens.\" - Robyn, Broken Arrow, OK resident\n\n• \"I was in Oklahoma City during the tornado... we were right in its path. Your app literally was a life saver.\" - dcalk12\n\n\nBenefits include:\n• Get NOAA alerts via voice and push notification no matter where you are in the United States.\n\n• Share severe weather alerts with your family and friends to make sure they stay safe.\n\n• Beautifully sharp radar map as your home screen so you can immediately see what's going on at your current and saved locations.\n\n• Share your radar view with family and friends when severe weather is affecting them.\n\n• See where NOAA watches and warnings are issued by switching map overlays.\n\n• See Hurricane and Tropical Storm forecast tracks.\n\n• Save five additional locations to make sure friends and family at home, work, or out of state stay safe.\n\n• School Closings for Baltimore, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Denver, Detroit, Indianapolis, Kansas City, Tulsa and Buffalo.\n\n• View current conditions, hourly and daily forecasts.\n\n• Severe weather forecasts in the app. Know where bad weather will occur before you travel with forecasts by our Storm Shield Meteorologist.\n\n• Watch live video streams when available (usually during local coverage of severe weather in cities listed below).\n\n\nBattery tips: \n• Storm Shield uses iOS Significant-Change Location and Background Refresh (not GPS) to balance location accuracy and battery life.\n\n• Turn off Background Tracking and instead set one of your five locations to where you are most often.\n\n\nStorm Shield is made possible by The E.W.

We don’t waste student’s time with random scholarships they don't qualify for nor do we populate our database with non-scholarship items like loans, internships, and advertisements.

Tap, flip and rotate simple shapes to explore complex polyrhythms. Gestural control of beat distribution algorithms allows for the step-by-step generation of rhythmic shapes. Layer intricate beats in a matter of minutes, then save them for later or export to MIDI.\n\n- Build rhythms on up to four necklaces.\n- Adjust the length of each individual cycle to quickly create complex rhythmic ratios\n- Use a collection of rhythm building algorithms and geometric transformations to create and morph your rhythm.\n-Tap your tempo, use a slider for transitions, or manually type the global speed of your song\n- Choose from a variety of pitched sounds and percussive sample sets.\n- Quickly modulate between notes in four musical modes (pentatonic, major, minor, chromatic) and five octaves.\n- Customize the attack and panning of sounds to suit your composition\n- Save your sessions and export them as midi. \n- E-mail copies of midi sessions to yourself. These can be opened and edited on most DAWs.\n- Midi in/out allows you to fully customize your sounds and record your compositions in real time within an external DAW environment.\n\nThe term ‘rhythm necklace’ is used in music to refer to circular representations of repeating patterns. By thinking about rhythms as shapes rather than a linear timeline, it’s easier to see geometric properties that make them enjoyable, such as evenness and symmetry. Often, even subtle changes to the visual interface can completely transform how a rhythm sounds.

Where the book describes in-depth and easy-to-understand terms the incredible developmental changes your baby goes through, the app is the perfect leap calendar companion to track your baby’s mental development (during the first 20 months). By knowing what is going on inside the head of your baby, you can help him to make the leap more easily and stimulate his development. \n\nThe Wonder Weeks app helps new parents by:   \n- Calendar Showing when your baby makes a leap in his mental development \n- What your baby can understand & learn after this mental leap  \n- What your baby can do after this leap  \n- What you can do to help your baby   \n\nThis app is also a handy reminder for new parents when their baby’s brain is changing, or “leaping,” the baby is making a significant advance in mental development, and with each step forward comes a drastic change in the way your baby sees the world around him. Because these leaps come so quickly, the “new world” and new abilities can sometimes be scary, and the development can initially manifest in poor sleep, bad appetite, crying, clinging and crankiness – exhausting and frustrating mom and dad. \n\nInternational experts on The Wonder Weeks:  “This is a very practical and entertaining window into the baby’s first year and a half. van de Rijt and Plooij have observed and found the vulnerable times in an infant’s development that I independently came to in my book Touchpoints (Perseus Books Group). The authors’ observations and practical suggestions are wonderful.”  -T. Berry Brazelton, M.D., professor emeritus, Harvard Medical School   \n\n\"Anyone who deals with infants and young children will want to read The Wonder Weeks. This book will open parents' eyes to aspects of their children's growth, development, changing behavior, and emotional responsiveness that they might otherwise not notice or find puzzling and distressing.\"  -Catherine Snow, Ph.D., Shattuck Professor of Education, Harvard Graduate School of Education   \n\n Disclaimer:   This App is developed with the greatest care.

ON SALE!  Only $.99! (reg. $4.99) -- HURRY Sale ends soon!\n\nThe #1 Emoji Keyboard replacement!  --  Remove the regular Emoji Keyboard RIGHT NOW and replace it with the next-generation CLIPish Emoji Keyboard!\n\nCLIPish Keyboard combines the new iOS 8.3 Emojis with the hugely popular CLIPish Pro app, right in your iPhone or iPad's keyboard!  Going way beyond the standard Emoji Keyboard, CLIPish Keyboard let’s quickly find and share MILLIONS of emojis, animations, gifs, and clip-art images, on literally any topic, right from WITHIN other apps such as Text Messaging, Email, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and hundreds more.\n\nTOP 10 REASONS to Replace the Emoji Keyboard with CLIPish Emoji Keyboard!\n\n1. OVER 5 MILLION IMAGES!  Instead of only 1180 images, choose from over 5 MILLION!!!\n\n2. ANIMATIONS!  Choose from millions of ANIMATIONS on any topic!\n\n3. CLIP ART!  Choose from millions of CLIP ART images on any topic!\n\n4. DOZENS OF CATEGORIES!  Dozens of Emoji categories, instead of only seven.\n\n5. KEYWORD SEARCH!  Find Emojis quickly by typing in keywords.\n\n6. FIVE SIZES!  Instead of only one image size, choose from FIVE!  (Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Original)\n\n7. FAVORITES!  Save your favorite images for quick access.\n\n8. ADD TEXT!  Customize images with your own text.\n\n9. EXTENDED EMOJIS:  Bonus extended and \"compatible\" emojis that work on non-iOS devices and websites, such as Android and Facebook.\n\n10. CLIPISH!  Based on the hugely popular #1 CLIPish app.\n\nAnd there's more...\n\n• No need to leave other apps, do everything right from the iOS keyboard!\n• Impress your friends by responding in seconds with the perfect image while text messaging.\n• Instantly resize images with one tap before sharing.\n• For a better look, swipe though images full screen rather than tiny thumbnails.\n• Supports sharing with any app that supports Copy & Paste or Importing from your photo library.\n• Supports Text Messaging, Email, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, WhatsApp, SnapChat, and hundreds more.\n• Filter searches by either emoji, animations or clip art (or all three combined).\n• Saves recent images for quick re-sharing. \n\nINSTALLATION:\n\nCLIPish Keyboard is a \"keyboard extension\" app.  You only run the actual app in order to view the tutorials of how to install and use it.  Once you've followed the installation video, you access the app from your device's keyboard by touching the \"globe\" icon.  Installation and use is VERY easy, just follow the tutorial videos in the main app.\n\n\nNOTES:  \n\n- \"ALLOWING FULL ACCESS\" - PLEASE READ BEFORE GIVING A BAD REVIEW:  This video SHOWS you exactly why it's safe:  http://tinyurl.com/safefullaccess  Because this app downloads images from the Internet, in order for it to work, it requires that the Allow Full Access option be turned on.  However, with CLIPish Keyboard, NO personal information is ever entered, recorded, saved, shared, or sent to our servers by the app, SINCE YOU DON'T USE CLIPish Keyboard FOR ACTUAL \"TEXT\" typing. \n\n- FAST INTERNET CONNECTION REQUIRED:  This app requires an Internet connection and works best for users with a strong cell or WiFi connection.\n\n- COMPATIBILITY WITH NON-iPHONE USERS:  Depending on what cell network and type of cell phone the person you're sending to has, some of the animations you send via text messaging may not \"play.\"\n\n- FAMILIES:  This app is rated 17+ because it accesses Internet content and is not appropriate for unsupervised children.  For the strongest protection, set your rating filter to Strict.\n\n- ANIMATIONS ON FACEBOOK AND TWITTER:  Some apps and services do not allow moving animations and will \"flatten\" animations when uploaded to their sites, such as Facebook, Twitter and others.  \n\n- You must be running iOS 8.3 to view the \"new\" Emojis properly.\n\n- Some images featured are public domain.  If you believe your work has been included in err, please let us know so it can be removed.\n\nNeed help or have a suggestion?

Or point your device at a plane in the sky to find out where it’s going and more. Discover today why millions are already tracking flights with Flightradar24.\n\nFeatures that have helped make Flightradar24 - Flight Tracker the #1 selling app in 115 countries include: \n* Watch planes move in real-time on detailed map\n* Identify planes flying overhead by simply pointing your device at the sky (requires GPS equipped device)\n* Experience what the pilot of a an aircraft sees in real-time and in 3D (requires iPhone 4S, iPad 2, iPod Touch 5th gen., and above + iOS 6.0 or higher)\n* Tap on a plane for comprehensive flight and aircraft information such as route, estimated time of arrival, actual time of departure, aircraft type, speed, altitude, and high-resolution picture\n* Tap on an airport icon for current delay stats and weather conditions\n* Easy to search for individual flights using flight number, airport, or airline\n* Easy to filter by airline, aircraft, altitude, speed, and more\n* Easy to set bookmarks to enable quick navigation to areas of interest\n* Turn the device into the arrivals and departures board of any major airport and get real-time status updates for flights (in-app purchase)\n* Realistic aircraft symbols (in-app purchase)\n* Set up custom alerts based on airline, aircraft type, flight number or registration (in-app purchase) \n\nHOW IT WORKS\nMost aircraft today are equipped with so called ADS-B transponders that transmit positional data. Flightradar 24 has a rapidly growing network of several thousand ground stations around the world to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions Flightradar24, with the help of multilateration, is able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders.\n\nTraditional radar data is also used in the app thanks to a direct feed from the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). This data provides near real-time coverage of all US and Canadian airspace.\n\n***IMPORTANT NOTICE - COVERAGE***\nFlightradar24 provides unrivaled positional aircraft data coverage around the world but there are areas where we don’t have coverage. If you are only interested in tracking air traffic in a specific region, we suggest that you check our website BEFORE purchasing the app. \n\nOverview of coverage as of April 2015:\n* Europe: close to 100%\n* North America: 100% of US and Canada via slightly delayed radar data. Real-time coverage for most of US, Canada and Mexico for ADS-B equipped aircraft\n* South America: Substantial coverage in most countries including Brazil, Argentina and Chile\n* Asia: Substantial coverage in most major Asian countries including Japan, India, Indonesia, South Korea, Thailand, UAE, Malaysia, Taiwan and many other countries. Rapidly expanding coverage in China \n* Oceania: Nearly complete coverage in Australia and New Zealand\n* Africa: Substantial coverage in South Africa. Limited but growing coverage in the rest of the region\n\nCoverage is subject to change at any time.\n\nCONNECT WITH FLIGHTRADAR24\nLike us on Facebook and follow @flightradar24 on Twitter.\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThe use of this app is strictly limited to entertainment purposes.

Sleeptracker is within 95% accuracy of professional sleep monitors used in sleep clinics. Sleeptracker technology continually analyzes your sleep throughout the night to determine the best possible moment to wake you, helping you wake up refreshed and energetic. You can also record snoring or other sounds during the night to provide insight into how restful your sleep was.\n\n24/7 Sleeptracker vs other sleep monitors: only Sleeptracker’s patented technology can help you WAKE UP AT THE OPTIMAL TIME™.  Unlike other products, Sleeptracker doesn’t just wake you up because you simply moved, it analyzes your sleep patterns throughout the entire night to wake you at the best possible moment to help you feel the most refreshed and energetic!\n\n…………………………….\n\nWhen analyzing your sleep, please ensure you place your iPhone according to the instructions, either in bed or in an armband, so 24/7 can accurately monitor your sleep and wake you at the optimal time. Please see the in-app guidance for placement tips.\n\nNOTE: Placing your iPhone on a solid surface such as the floor or a table while recording sleep causes 24/7 to become highly sensitive to movement. This level of sensitivity is required for users sleeping on a motion-absorbing mattress (such as BeautyRest and Tempur-Pedic). However, with the iPhone on the floor or table, noise from the accelerometer sensor can be registered as sleep cycles resulting in a random sleep graph and random sleep statistics. \n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."}, "im:price":{"label":"$0.99", "attributes":{"amount":"0.99000", "currency":"USD"}}, "im:contentType":{"attributes":{"term":"Application", "label":"Application"}}, "rights":{"label":"© 2003-2015 Fullpower Technologies, Inc."}, "title":{"label":"MotionX 24/7: Sleeptracker, Sleep Cycle Alarm, Snore, Apnea, Heart Rate Monitor, Weight Loss, Activity Tracker - MotionX™"}, "link":{"attributes":{"rel":"alternate", "type":"text/html", "href":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/motionx-24-7-sleeptracker/id505074676?mt=8&uo=2"}}, "id":{"label":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/motionx-24-7-sleeptracker/id505074676?mt=8&uo=2", "attributes":{"im:id":"505074676", "im:bundleId":"com.fullpower.MotionXSleep"}}, "im:artist":{"label":"MotionX™", "attributes":{"href":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/motionx/id282995850?mt=8&uo=2"}}, "category":{"attributes":{"im:id":"6020", "term":"Medical", "scheme":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/genre/ios-medical/id6020?mt=8&uo=2", "label":"Medical"}}, "im:releaseDate":{"label":"2012-03-07T17:02:27-07:00", "attributes":{"label":"March 7, 2012"}}},

You'll need to whip up delicious Freezer sundaes by pouring ice cream, adding mixables and syrups, blending sundaes, adding whipped cream and toppings, and don't forget the cherry on top for a perfect summertime treat!\r\n\r\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Build Station to combine ice cream and mixables for each sundae.  Jump to the Mix Station to mix sundaes until they're blended just right.  Hop to the Top Station to pour whipped cream and toppings before serving the sundae to your picky customers.  Each Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the sundae-building process.\r\n\r\nKeep your customers happy to earn points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings for the shop, and new customers will start to visit the Freezeria!  A well-crafted sundae also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\r\n\r\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S FREEZERIA TO GO**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\r\n\r\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\r\n\r\nBUILD STATION - We've completely redesigned the Build Station for smaller screens.  The Pour Button and Bonus Meter are moved to the side and sized just right for your thumb, so you can watch the meter and tap at the right time without any fingers blocking your view.  When it's time to choose a mixable or a syrup, the entire screen is filled with large buttons so you can easily tap the correct item.\r\n\r\nMIX STATION - We've fine-tuned the Mix Station upgrades to work even better on small touch screens.  Once you purchase the Blend Alarm upgrades, you can drag these large alarms and snap them onto any blender.  Booster Buttons are also large and easy to press, and you can even use multi-touch to boost multiple blenders at once!\r\n\r\nTOP STATION - The Topping Bin carousel from \"Papa's Burgeria To Go!\" is back, which lets you top sundaes in a brand-new way!  Swipe the carousel of Topping Bins to choose the item you want to use, then grab the sundae cup to start pouring toppings evenly across the sundae.  You can also tap a button to switch to placeable items like cherries and cookies.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the cup below, so you'll have those sundaes finished in no time!\r\n\r\nNEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients that can't be found in the classic or HD versions of the game, including mixables, syrups, whipped cream flavors, and other toppings that you'll unlock as you play the game.

It is packed with innovative features. Here are just some of them:\n\n1. Flash browsing support\n- Photon Browser allows you to play Flash games such as free Facebook games, use Flash apps and watch Flash video inline using its remote cloud browse mode.\n- Browse Flash websites that would otherwise not display on the iPhone.\n- Play music that streams through a Flash player.\n- Read news that require Flash support.\n- Press the “Lightning” icon on the bottom right navigation bar when you encounter a Flash website on the iPhone or iPod Touch.\n- Combines fast native browsing for normal websites and remote browsing for Flash websites. Switch between the 2 modes using the lightning bolt button (for Flash) or the web globe button (for native browsing).\n- Support different mode such as pointer mode for precision that makes your iPhone acts like a mouse pad. Supports touch mode for scrolling and touch/click. Supports drag mode for dragging around game maps.\n- Zoom in flash. PLEASE WAIT a second or two for the zoom to update before zooming again on iPhone and iPod touches.\n- We support audio. PLEASE MAKE sure your mute switch is not on.\n\n2. Fully featured powerful browser\n- Private browsing clears history, cookies and caches upon browser exit.\n- Anonymous browsing through our servers.\n- Share content via email.\n- Brightness control for night time browsing.\n- Rotation lock for playing web based games.\n- Personalize your browser by choosing from thousands of colors.\n\n3. Others\n- Bookmarks support\n- Print web pages using AirPrint.\n- More innovative features to come\n\nImportant notes - PLEASE READ BEFORE BUYING:\n- When you encounter a Flash website, REMEMBER TO CLICK ON the \"Lightning Bolt\" button to enter Flash streaming mode. Otherwise, you will see the standard Adobe message that Flash needs to be installed or upgraded as you are still in the native browser mode. Only by explicitly clicking on the \"Lightning\" button will you then be able to view Flash content.\n\n- If you have a slow Internet connection such as over a slow 3G network, remote browsing feature may have slow performance even though we have made great technological improvements to support Flash over low bandwidth. Flash mode works best over Wifi in a broadband network. Just because you have Wifi does not mean you have a fast network. Wifi is fast enough but your bottleneck is the wired connection that your Wifi sits on. However, you can still use Photon as a fast native browser for your regular browsing.\n\n- If you have problems, do not hesitate to contact us given in the support link on iTunes. We are extremely responsive and answer questions within 1-3 business days.

The look on their face as they race to see what’s happened to their car will be priceless.\n\nFeatures\n1) Take pictures or use existing pictures from your album\n2) Apply one or all of the following damage types:\nDents\nScratches\nBroken Glass\nCar boot\nFire or Smoke\n3) Adjust the size, shape, orientation, contrast, brightness, opacity of the selected damage type\n4) Save the edited image to your album or email it\n\nHow To Use The Application\nStep 1. Select/take a picture of the car you plan on using.\nStep 2. Mark the area where you wish to apply the damage.\nStep 3. Apply a damage type (e.g. dent, scratch, broken glass, boot).\nStep 4. Adjust the damage type by using the available tools\nStep 5. Repeat steps 2-4 if you are applying more than one damage type.\nStep 6. Take a moment to enjoy the masterpiece you have created.\nStep 7. Save or share the picture via email or facebook.\n\nAdditional Tips\n1) The quality of the damage is only limited by your fantasy!\n2) Add / overlay several damages to make the damage more realistic.\n3) You can move or re-size the damage on the car with the your fingers.\n4) Use the “Eraser” tool to adjust the edges of the damage.\n\nMore Info\nFor more information on “Dude, your car!” go to mobilaga.com, visit our Facebook profile at mobilaga.com/facebook, or follow us on Twitter at twitter.com/mobilaga\n\nWatch the video at youtube.com/mobilaga !!!\n\nWe welcome your reviews and thank you for your support!"}, "im:price":{"label":"$0.99", "attributes":{"amount":"0.99000", "currency":"USD"}}, "im:contentType":{"attributes":{"term":"Application", "label":"Application"}}, "rights":{"label":"© mobilaga"}, "title":{"label":"Dude, your car! - mobilaga inc."}, "link":{"attributes":{"rel":"alternate", "type":"text/html", "href":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dude-your-car!/id358055270?mt=8&uo=2"}}, "id":{"label":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dude-your-car!/id358055270?mt=8&uo=2", "attributes":{"im:id":"358055270", "im:bundleId":"com.mobilaga.dudeyourcar"}}, "im:artist":{"label":"mobilaga inc."}, "category":{"attributes":{"im:id":"6016", "term":"Entertainment", "scheme":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/genre/ios-entertainment/id6016?mt=8&uo=2", "label":"Entertainment"}}, "im:releaseDate":{"label":"2010-03-05T00:00:00-07:00", "attributes":{"label":"March 5, 2010"}}},

The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.\n\nFrom your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!\n\nCan you survive five nights at Freddy's?\n\n\"For all the simplicity of the game’s controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddy‘s is frightening. It’s a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and toys.

The result is an image that overcomes the limited range of a digital image sensor and reflects what the human eye can actually see.\n\nBy taking advantage of the new burst mode in iOS 8, Fusion takes three bracketed exposures in 3/10ths of a second. The brackets can be automatically calculated based on algorithmic analysis of the scene, or manually specified. Exposure can be locked using a spot meter mode similar to a DSLR and can also be manually adjusted. A histogram gives you the technical info you need.\n\nYou can save multiple shots to the recent sessions list or go directly to the Fusion editor. The editor instantly aligns the photos to remove any slight camera movement and then presents an initial fused result. Then Fusion blends the best exposed areas of the under exposed and over exposed brackets, with the main bracket. \n\nThe shadow/highlight controls allow you to get the look you want. From subtle lighting improvement to intense HDR. The editor includes all the adjustments you'll need to create a beautiful photo. Basic lighting adjustments and white balance as well as color controls.\n\nThe session list stores the bracketed photos as you shoot and allows you to go back and re-open sessions for editing.\n\nTech Specs\n\nCamera features\n\n     • spot meter\n     • manual exposure adjustment\n     • histogram display\n     • shake detection\n     • timer\n     • multi-shot session capture\n\nEditor features\n\n     • adjustable highlight and shadow bracket fusing\n     • auto alignment\n     • exposure, contrast and sharpness\n     • white balance\n     • saturation and warmth\n     • crop\n\nSession features\n\n     • thumbnail display of the three brackets\n     • delete sessions\n     • re-open sessions in the editor\n     • store up to 200 sessions"}, "im:price":{"label":"$1.99", "attributes":{"amount":"1.99000", "currency":"USD"}}, "im:contentType":{"attributes":{"term":"Application", "label":"Application"}}, "rights":{"label":"© 2015 East Coast Pixels, Inc."}, "title":{"label":"Fusion - HDR Camera - East Coast Pixels, Inc."}, "link":{"attributes":{"rel":"alternate", "type":"text/html", "href":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fusion-hdr-camera/id961711923?mt=8&uo=2"}}, "id":{"label":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fusion-hdr-camera/id961711923?mt=8&uo=2", "attributes":{"im:id":"961711923", "im:bundleId":"com.eastcoastpixels.fusion"}}, "im:artist":{"label":"East Coast Pixels, Inc.", "attributes":{"href":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/east-coast-pixels-inc./id380588089?mt=8&uo=2"}}, "category":{"attributes":{"im:id":"6008", "term":"Photo & Video", "scheme":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/genre/ios-photo-video/id6008?mt=8&uo=2", "label":"Photo & Video"}}, "im:releaseDate":{"label":"2015-04-16T00:00:00-07:00", "attributes":{"label":"April 16, 2015"}}},

RainAware relies on National Weather Service radars and may not work properly if a radar is down or if the beam is blocked by mountains. In rare instances, ground clutter may result in a false positive for rain at your location. Extremely light sprinkles or drizzle may not always be detected. Precipitation times will change as RainAware adjusts to rapidly changing weather conditions. Precipitation can form suddenly or dissipate at any time. RainAware may not work well in mountainous terrain where radar beams can be blocked. Works best when precipitation is moving.
